# Sync Main Branch

Switch to the main branch and pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

## Instructions

1. Switch to the main branch using `git checkout main`
2. Pull the latest changes using `git pull`
3. Show a summary of what changed (files modified, commits added)
4. Inform the user that they're now on main with the latest changes

## Notes

- If there are uncommitted changes, git will warn about them
- If the branch is already up to date, let the user know
- Show the most recent commits if changes were pulled
